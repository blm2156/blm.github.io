My name is Britney. I am currently finishing my second (and final) year of graduate school where I am working towards earning my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics. I am going on my second year living in NYC and have absolutlely loved it. The view from my apartment isn't so bad either.

Originally, I am from a small river town in Central-West NJ. I also have dog named Luna (featured in the photo). I love the outdoors, love to explore, and love to stay active and busy.
