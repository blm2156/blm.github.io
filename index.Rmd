Hello there and welcome to my website!

![](PFZ_0420.JPG)

My name is Britney. I am currently finishing my second (and final) year of graduate school where I am working towards earning my Master of Public Health in Epidemiology with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics. Originally, I am from a small river town in Central-West NJ. I also have dog named Luna (featured in the photo).
